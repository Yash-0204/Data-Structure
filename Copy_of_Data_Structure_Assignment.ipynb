        "\n",
        "    A data structure is an organised way of storing,managing organising data in a computer so that it can be assesed and modified efficiently.\n",
        "    They are of two types\n",
        "    1: Primitive data structures like integer, float, character and boolean.\n",
        "    2:Non-Primitive data type like arrays, strings, linked list, stacks etc.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    They are important because of the following reason\n",
        "    1: Efficiency\n",
        "    2: Solving complex problems\n",
        "    3:Optimal Resource Management\n",

        "Q.2 Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with\n",
        "    examples?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Mutable data types: The contents or value of the object can be changed (modified) after it is created.\n",
        "    Example: List, Disctinaries, Sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Immutable data types: Once an object is created, its contents or value cannot be modified. Any operation that would modify it results in a new object being created.\n",
        "    Example: Strings, Tuples, Integers etc\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.3 What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    The main difference between list and tuples are as follows:\n",
        "    1: Lists are mutable where as tuples are immutable.\n",
        "    2: Lists are defined by square brackets [] whereas tuples are defined by\n",
        "    paranthesis ().\n",
        "    3: Lists are slower due to mutablity whereas tuples are faster.\n",
        "    4: Lists requires more memory dur to mutablity where as tuple are memory efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.4 Describe how dictionaries store data?\n",
        "    \n",
        "    a dictionary (often abbreviated as dict) is a built-in data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. This allows efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions based on the keys. Dictionaries are unordered collections of data, meaning that the elements do not have a fixed order, and the order may change between different runs of the program.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Key characterictics are\n",
        "    1: Key value pair: Each dictinaries contain a key and its corresponding value.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Dictionaries store data by using a hash function to map keys to specific memory locations, making it efficient to look up, insert, and delete key-value pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.5 Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    It is because of the following reasons\n",
        "    1: Sets does not allow duplicates of the same data whereas lists allows duplication of data\n",
        "    2: Sets membership tests are faster than list membership test.\n",
        "    3: Sets supports operations like union,difference and intesection in more efficient way than lists. Lists requires alot of manual efforts and time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.6 What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "    \n",
        "    A string is a sequence of characters, commonly used to represent text. It is one of the built-in data types in Python, and it is an immutable type means it can not be modified.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    There are following reasons like:\n",
        "    1: String only contains characters whereas list contain integer, float, character, boolean values.\n",
        "    2: Strings are immutable as they cannot be modified whereas lists are mutable and can be modiefied efficiently.\n",
        "    3: Strings can be used in text procession and manipulation whereas in list the general purpose is the collections of items.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.7 How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Tuples help ensure data integrity primarily through their immutability. This means that once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be altered in any way. The immutability of tuples plays a key role in ensuring data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.8 What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    A hash table is a data structure that provides an efficient way to store and retrieve key-value pairs. It is one of the foundational structures used to implement associative arrays, maps, or dictionaries in many programming languages, including Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Reasons why dictionaries are related to hash table are as follows\n",
        "    !: They both use key values pair.\n",
        "    2: Immutablity of the keys\n",
        "    3: They provide more efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.9 Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Yes, lists in Python can contain different data types. Unlike some other programming languages, which might require all elements in a list (or array) to be of the same type, Python lists are heterogeneous, meaning you can store a mix of various data types (e.g., integers, strings, floats, booleans, lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.) in the same list.\n",
        "    Example:\n",
        "    My_list = [1, 2,5, \"Yash\", True]\n",
        "\n",
        "q.10: Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "      Strings in Python are immutable because this design decision provides numerous benefits, including memory efficiency, data integrity, safety in multi-threaded environments, hashability for use in dictionaries and sets, and simplicity in programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.11 What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "     \n",
        "     Dictionaries offer significant advantages over lists in certain tasks due to their fast lookups, ability to store key-value pairs, and more flexible handling of complex data. They are ideal for tasks that involve mapping, fast access, ensuring uniqueness of keys etc.\n",
        "    \n",
        "Q.12 Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n",
        "\n",
        "     In scenarios where you need an immutable collection, such as representing fixed values (e.g. coordinates, RGB colors), tuples are preferable over lists. Their immutability ensures data integrity, makes them more efficient in terms of memory usage, and allows them to be used as dictionary keys or set elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.13 How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "     \n",
        "      A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. This means that sets automatically handle duplicate values by discarding any repeated elements.\n",
        "      \n",
        "      Every element in the sets are unique elements, if you add a duplicate, it will be ignored. Sets are implemented using hash tables which allowes for more efficience membership test.(which removes duplicate data)\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.14  How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "      \n",
        "      When we use in keyword in list, it checks whether the value is present or not. The operation iterates through the list, searching for the element, if element exists it return True or else it retuns False.\n",
        "\n",
        "      when we use in keyword in dictionaries, it checks whether the key exists in the dictionary, not the value. The operation works by checking the key in the dictionaries list of key.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.15 Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n",
        "\n",
        "     Tuples are immutable: Once a tuple is created, you cannot change, add, or remove elements.\n",
        "     Immutability ensures that tuples are hashable, making them useful as dictionary keys and set elements, and it optimizes memory usage and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.16 What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "\n",
        "     A nested dictionary in Python is simply a dictionary where the values themselves are dictionaries (or other data structures such as lists, tuples, etc.). In other words, it’s a dictionary whose values are other dictionaries, allowing for hierarchical or multi-level data storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Key Characteristics:\n",
        "\n",
        "     Hierarchical Structure: A nested dictionary can represent complex data with multiple levels of categorization, which is useful for modeling real-world problems or organizing structured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Dynamic and Flexible: Since dictionaries can store any data type as values (including other dictionaries), nested dictionaries offer flexibility in representing complex relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Accessing Nested Data: To access data within a nested dictionary, you need to use multiple keys, one for each level of nesting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.17 Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n",
        "\n",
        "     The time complexity of accessing elements in a Python dictionary is typically O(1) (constant time), meaning that, on average, dictionary lookups are very fast and do not depend on the size of the dictionary. This is one of the key advantages of dictionaries and makes them ideal for situations where fast lookups are important.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.18 In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "     We should prefer lists over dictionaries in these situations:\n",
        "\n",
        "     1: When the order of elements is important.\n",
        "     2: When your data is homogeneous and does not need key-value associations.\n",
        "     3: When you want to sort or modify elements.\n",
        "     4: When you need to access elements by position (indexing).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.19 Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data\n",
        "     retrieval?\n",
        "\n",
        "     Dictionaries in Python are considered unordered because they do not guarantee any specific order of the key-value pairs. This characteristic has to do with the underlying data structure used to implement dictionaries, which is a hash table.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.20 Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data\n",
        "     retrieval?\n",
        "\n",
        "     The primary difference between a list and a dictionary in Python, in terms of data retrieval, lies in how the data is stored, accessed, and retrieved.\n",
        "\n",
        "     There are following Reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "     1: Lists are ordered collection of items whereas dictionaries are\n",
        "        unordered which make it difficult to raad.\n",
        "     2: Lists uses method of indexed integer position(indexing) (list[index])\n",
        "        for data retrieval where as dictionaries uses indexed by keys(any immutable type) (dict[key]).\n",
        "     3: Lists allows duplication of data which harms the integrity of data\n",
        "        whereas dictionaries does not allow duplication.     \n",
